# 🐾 Petiverse: NFT Pet Game

Welcome to Petiverse!
Petiverse is an engaging NFT-based pet game where you mint, care for and upgrade your digital pets. The game challenges you to nurture your pets through regular feeding and exercise, allowing them to grow stronger and happier over time.

## 🎮 Game Features

### Mint Your Pet
Players can mint unique NFT pets with different traits that influence their performance in the game. Each pet has its own stats and characteristics.

### Pet Stats
Every pet has three key stats (Agility, Strength, Intelligence) and three secondary stats (Health, Hydration, Happiness) that you must maintain through proper care.

### Feeding & Exercising
Keep your pet healthy and happy by feeding and exercising them regularly. Missing feeding or exercise will negatively impact their stats.

### Upgrade Your Pet
Once secondary stats reach a certain level, you can upgrade your pet's key stats by solving fun Wordle-style games.

### Wordle Game for Stat Upgrade
Solve word puzzles to improve your pet's key stats and help them achieve greatness.

### NFT Cards
Each pet is represented by an NFT card that displays its current stats and status.
